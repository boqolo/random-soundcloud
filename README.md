<h1> A Random Soundcloud Track Generator Radio Web App </h1>

<em> But why? </em>
<p> Why not? </p>
<br>
<em> Okay, but surely you have something better to do. </em>
<p> You got me there... </p>
<br>
The Random Soundcloud Track Generator (RSTG) is a tool fit for longstanding music-lovers, 
neophiles, adventurous ears, and auditory explorers alike. Tracks generated are as random as 
can be, selecting from the subset of soundcloud that is publically licensed, moderately short in duration, and not the
 chart-topping
stuff you hear from those sterile spotify-generated playlists (aka low in popularity). Why listen to something you
 already know 
you'll like when you can get something completely different and completely exciting?! (If you can withstand
traversing the abyss soundcloud really is..)
<br>
<br>
Maybe you're looking for inspiration, or wondering what in the hell kind of tracks your fellow humans are cooking up and
 posting
 on this massive ecosystem. Maybe you're searching for that next golden sample. Maybe you're thinking this thing is
  stupid and are spamming the 'next' button
  pushing
  the boundary on what crazy thing you can find next. Maybe you don't care about all the 'irrlevant' tracks that
   exist out there. Or, perhaps you're
   looking to
  discover the pearls you've heard about that lie at the
  bottom of the server
 somewhere waiting for a discerning ear to hear them for what they truly are. The algorithms and the masses have
  either overlooked them, or misjudged them. No longer will these wonderful tracks and
   artists remain
   unearthed. 
   <br>
   <br>
   Well, now you've got a shovel.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Enter: the RSTG.</strong>
